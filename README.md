# gradient-generator
Pure JS linear-gradient generator
# How does it work?
- choose the type of a gradient
- type your colours
- click a button under the box where you will see your gradient
# Hint
If you wrote wrong names of some of your colours, the generator would not work - it would show you
white background in the box.
